## FizzBuzz
- this is the first java project I had to figure out first week into the my coding bootcamp.

### Description
A timeless classic. One of the origin stories for this kata is that it models a playground game where children took turns saying sequential numbers, but substituting the words Fizz and/or Buzz when the number was a multiple of 3 and/or 5.

This kata is a popular white boarding exercise, to a point where it is almost a white boarding cliche. This kata is great for practicing small steps, writing the most basic code needed to make a unit test pass, and refactoring.
